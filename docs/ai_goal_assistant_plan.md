# AI Financial Goal Assistant - Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for implementing an AI-based goal assistant in the Django Budget Tracker application. The assistant will analyze spending patterns and provide personalized recommendations to help users reach their financial goals, without requiring external paid API services.

## Core Features

1. **Goal Setting System**: Allow users to create financial goals with target amounts and deadlines
2. **Expense Analysis**: Analyze historical spending patterns by category
3. **AI Recommendations**: Generate tailored savings recommendations based on patterns
4. **Progress Tracking**: Monitor and visualize progress toward goals
5. **Smart Notifications**: Provide timely reminders and feedback

## Technical Approach

### 1. Backend Components

#### Goal Management
- Create a `Goal` model with fields for target amount, deadline, purpose, and progress
- Design APIs for CRUD operations on goals

#### Data Processing
- Develop a module to analyze expense patterns by category
- Implement time-series analysis to identify spending trends
- Detect core/essential vs. discretionary expenses

#### AI Recommendation Engine
- Use scikit-learn (free, open-source) for building a recommendation system
- Implement a rules-based engine combined with ML for tailored advice
- Store and categorize previous recommendations for continuous learning

### 2. Machine Learning Components (Free)

#### Expense Classification
- Train a model to classify expenses as "essential" vs "discretionary"
- Use simple clustering algorithms to group similar expenses

#### Savings Opportunity Detection
- Implement anomaly detection to find unusual spending
- Create regression models to predict future spending

#### Recommendation Generation
- Use decision trees to create a hierarchical recommendation system
- Implement collaborative filtering to find patterns across similar users (if multi-user)

### 3. Frontend Components

#### Goal Dashboard
- Create a visual dashboard for goal management
- Implement progress tracking with charts

#### Recommendation Interface
- Design a conversational UI for interacting with the AI advisor
- Show actionable recommendations with expected impact

#### Notification System
- Implement timely alerts for goal progress
- Create a system for feedback on recommendation usefulness

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Goal Management System (2-3 days)
- [ ] Create the Goal model and database schema
- [ ] Implement CRUD operations for goals
- [ ] Build basic goal setting and tracking UI

### Phase 2: Data Analysis Framework (3-4 days)
- [ ] Develop modules for analyzing historical expense data
- [ ] Implement essential vs. discretionary expense classification
- [ ] Create visualizations for spending patterns

### Phase 3: ML/AI Engine (5-7 days)
- [ ] Integrate scikit-learn for prediction models
- [ ] Implement the recommendation engine
- [ ] Create training pipelines for expense classification

### Phase 4: Recommendation Interface (3-4 days)
- [ ] Build the conversational UI
- [ ] Implement the recommendation display system
- [ ] Create feedback mechanisms for recommendation quality

### Phase 5: Integration and Testing (2-3 days)
- [ ] Integrate all components
- [ ] Perform testing with real user data
- [ ] Optimize performance and recommendation quality

## Technical Components

### 1. Database Models

```python
# New models to add:
class Goal(models.Model):
    user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    target_amount = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2)
    current_amount = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2, default=0)
    deadline = models.DateField()
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    category = models.CharField(max_length=50, choices=GOAL_CATEGORIES)
    priority = models.IntegerField(default=1)
    notes = models.TextField(blank=True)

class Recommendation(models.Model):
    goal = models.ForeignKey(Goal, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    text = models.TextField()
    potential_saving = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2)
    expense_category = models.ForeignKey('Category', on_delete=models.SET_NULL, null=True)
    generated_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    is_applied = models.BooleanField(default=False)
    feedback_rating = models.IntegerField(null=True, blank=True)
```

### 2. AI/ML Components (Free)

We'll use these free libraries:
- **scikit-learn** for ML models
- **pandas** for data manipulation
- **Django-Q** for background processing

### 3. Required Packages

```
scikit-learn==1.3.0
pandas==2.0.3
matplotlib==3.7.2
django-q==1.3.9
nltk==3.8.1
```

## UI/UX Design Approach

1. **Goal Setting Wizard**:
   - Step-by-step interface for creating goals
   - Visual selection of goal categories
   - Timeline visualization

2. **AI Advisor Interface**:
   - Conversational style recommendations
   - Visual impact indicators for suggestions
   - "Impact calculator" showing how recommendations affect goal timeline

3. **Progress Dashboard**:
   - Progress bars and charts
   - Milestone celebrations
   - Recommendation history and impact tracking
