# AI Goal Assistant - Implementation Roadmap

This document outlines the detailed implementation steps for the AI-based financial goal assistant feature.

## Phase 1: Goal Management System (2-3 days)

### Database Models
- [ ] Create `Goal` model with the following fields:
  - `user` (ForeignKey to User)
  - `name` (CharField)
  - `description` (TextField)
  - `target_amount` (DecimalField)
  - `current_amount` (DecimalField)
  - `start_date` (DateField)
  - `target_date` (DateField)
  - `category` (CharField with choices)
  - `priority` (CharField with choices)
  - `is_active` (BooleanField)
  - `created_at` and `updated_at` (DateTimeFields)

- [ ] Create `GoalContribution` model:
  - `goal` (ForeignKey to Goal)
  - `amount` (DecimalField)
  - `date` (DateField)
  - `source` (CharField with choices)
  - `notes` (TextField)

### API Endpoints
- [ ] Create CRUD endpoints for goals:
  - GET `/api/goals/` - List all goals
  - POST `/api/goals/` - Create a new goal
  - GET `/api/goals/<id>/` - Get goal details
  - PUT `/api/goals/<id>/` - Update goal
  - DELETE `/api/goals/<id>/` - Delete goal
  - GET `/api/goals/<id>/contributions/` - List contributions
  - POST `/api/goals/<id>/contributions/` - Add contribution

### Basic UI Components
- [ ] Create goal listing component
- [ ] Implement goal creation wizard
- [ ] Build goal detail view
- [ ] Add goal editing interface
- [ ] Develop goal progress visualization

## Phase 2: Data Analysis Framework (3-4 days)

### Data Processor Components
- [ ] Create `ExpenseAnalyzer` module:
  - [ ] Implement method to categorize expenses
  - [ ] Create logic to identify spending patterns
  - [ ] Develop calculation for discretionary vs. essential spending

- [ ] Build `SavingsPotentialCalculator`:
  - [ ] Create algorithm to identify potential savings
  - [ ] Implement method to calculate impact of reducing expenses
  - [ ] Develop time-to-goal projection with various scenarios

### Background Jobs
- [ ] Set up Django-Q for background processing
- [ ] Create scheduled task for nightly data analysis
- [ ] Implement caching mechanism for analysis results

### Analytics Dashboard
- [ ] Create spending breakdown visualization
- [ ] Implement saving potential indicators
- [ ] Build progress-over-time charts

## Phase 3: ML/AI Engine (5-7 days)

### Data Preparation
- [ ] Create data cleaning and normalization pipeline
- [ ] Implement feature extraction for ML models
- [ ] Set up dataset building procedures

### Model Development
- [ ] Implement `ExpenseClassifier` model:
  - [ ] Train model to categorize expenses as essential vs. discretionary
  - [ ] Create evaluation metrics and validation procedure

- [ ] Build `SavingsOpportunityDetector`:
  - [ ] Develop clustering algorithm for spending pattern detection
  - [ ] Implement outlier detection for unusual expenses
  - [ ] Create baseline for normal spending in each category

- [ ] Create `RecommendationGenerator`:
  - [ ] Implement rule-based recommendation system
  - [ ] Develop personalization algorithm based on user behavior
  - [ ] Create prioritization logic for recommendations

### Integration Layer
- [ ] Build API for ML model predictions
- [ ] Create recommendation caching system
- [ ] Implement feedback collection for model improvement

## Phase 4: Recommendation Interface (3-4 days)

### Recommendation Models
- [ ] Create `Recommendation` model:
  - `goal` (ForeignKey to Goal)
  - `title` (CharField)
  - `description` (TextField)
  - `category` (CharField)
  - `potential_impact` (DecimalField)
  - `difficulty_level` (CharField with choices)
  - `implementation_steps` (JSONField)
  - `is_implemented` (BooleanField)
  - `user_feedback` (SmallIntegerField)
  - `created_at` (DateTimeField)

- [ ] Create `RecommendationFeedback` model:
  - `recommendation` (ForeignKey)
  - `was_helpful` (BooleanField)
  - `rating` (SmallIntegerField)
  - `comments` (TextField)

### UI Components
- [ ] Build recommendation card component
- [ ] Create recommendation detail modal
- [ ] Implement recommendation impact calculator
- [ ] Develop recommendation history view
- [ ] Build feedback collection interface

### AI Advisor Interface
- [ ] Create conversational UI for goal advice
- [ ] Implement structured responses for common questions
- [ ] Build suggestion system for follow-up questions
- [ ] Develop explanation system for recommendations

## Phase 5: Integration and Testing (2-3 days)

### System Integration
- [ ] Connect goal management with recommendation engine
- [ ] Integrate expense data with ML models
- [ ] Link recommendation feedback to model improvement

### Testing
- [ ] Create unit tests for core components
- [ ] Develop integration tests for the full system
- [ ] Implement frontend tests for UI components
- [ ] Create performance benchmarks for ML models

### User Experience
- [ ] Conduct usability testing
- [ ] Optimize UI for mobile devices
- [ ] Improve load times for data-heavy pages
- [ ] Implement progressive loading for recommendations

### Documentation
- [ ] Create user documentation
- [ ] Update API documentation
- [ ] Document ML models and training procedures
- [ ] Prepare maintenance guide
