## Key Features

2. Click the "New Goal" button
3. Fill in the form with your goal details:
   - **Name**: A clear, specific name for your goal
   - **Category**: (Optional) Choose a category or leave blank

### Viewing Goals

The Goals page displays three sections:
1. **Active Goals**: Goals you're currently working toward
2. **Completed Goals**: Goals where you've reached or exceeded the target amount
3. **Inactive Goals**: Goals you've paused but may resume later

Each goal card shows:
- Current and target amounts
- Progress percentage with visual indicator
- Target date (if set)
- Monthly contribution needed to stay on track
- Status indicator (on track or behind schedule)

### Adding Contributions

To record a contribution to a goal:
1. Click on the "Details" button for the goal
2. In the "Add Contribution" section, enter:
   - **Amount**: How much you're contributing
   - **Date**: When the contribution was made
   - **Source**: Where the funds came from
   - **Notes**: Any additional information (optional)
3. Click "Add Contribution"

### Viewing Goal Details

The goal detail page shows:
- Complete goal information
- Progress visualization
- Monthly contribution needed to reach your goal on time
- A list of all contributions made toward the goal
- Options to edit or delete the goal

## Progress Tracking Logic

- **Progress Percentage**: Calculated as (current_amount / target_amount) Ã— 100
- **On Track Status**: Determined by comparing your current saving rate to what's needed to reach the goal by the target date
- **Monthly Contribution Needed**: The amount you need to save monthly to reach your goal by the target date

## Tips for Effective Goal Management

1. **Set realistic deadlines**: Be honest about when you can achieve your goals
2. **Track regularly**: Add contributions as they happen to maintain an accurate picture
3. **Prioritize goals**: Focus on the most important goals first
4. **Set smaller milestones**: Break large goals into achievable steps
5. **Adjust when needed**: If circumstances change, update your goals accordingly
